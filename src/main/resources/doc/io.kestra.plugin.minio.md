# How to use the MinIO plugin

Upload, download, list, copy, and delete objects in MinIO (or any S3-compatible store) from Kestra flows.

## Authentication

Set `endpoint` to your MinIO server URL, `accessKeyId` to your access key, and `secretKeyId` to your secret key. Optionally set `region`. For TLS mutual auth, pass PEM content via `clientPem` and `caPem`. Store secrets in [secrets](https://kestra.io/docs/concepts/secret) and apply connection properties globally with [plugin defaults](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/plugin-defaults).

## Tasks

`Upload` writes a file to MinIO — set `bucket`, `key`, and `from` (a `kestra://` URI). Optionally set `contentType` and `metadata`.

`Download` retrieves a single object — set `bucket` and `key`. Optionally scope to a specific `versionId`. The output `uri` points to internal storage.

`Downloads` retrieves multiple objects matching a `prefix` — set `bucket` and optionally `prefix`, `regexp`, or `filter`. Use `action` and `moveTo` to move or delete source objects after download.

`List` returns objects in a `bucket` — filter with `prefix`, `regexp`, or `filter`. Set `recursive: true` to traverse subdirectories.

`Delete` removes a single object by `bucket` and `key`.

`DeleteList` removes multiple objects matching a `prefix` — set `bucket` and optionally `prefix`, `regexp`, or `filter`. Set `errorOnEmpty: false` to suppress errors when no objects match.

`Copy` copies an object — set `from` (with `bucket` and `key`) and `to` (with `bucket` and `key`). Set `delete: true` to move rather than copy.

`CreateBucket` creates a bucket by `bucket` name.

`Trigger` polls MinIO on a schedule and starts one execution per batch of matching objects. Set `bucket` and optionally `prefix`, `regexp`, or `filter`. Use `action` to move or delete objects after triggering to avoid reprocessing.
